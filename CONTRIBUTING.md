### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### Pull Requests

* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with ESLint and Prettier.

```javascript
// Use this format

  // code here
};
```

### CSS Styleguide

* Use TailwindCSS utility classes when possible
